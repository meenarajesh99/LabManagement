# LabManagement
Per Scholas case study - Laboratory Management System

Lab Management System is a web-based application that will allow admin/customers to add laboratory tests to the customer, edit and delete the tests.
This is the initial design which contains the main landing page, customer and testing services list pages, login/register for the application. The customer can register for an account, 
view a list of testing services. The admin can add, edit and delete customers and testing services, assign tests to customers.

Currently working on adding more functionalities to this project to meet the requirements of the initial Schema Diagram.
